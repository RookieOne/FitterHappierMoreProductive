  <h2>Brain has finite resources</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote>Because our brain's resources are limited, we are left with a choice: to use those finite resources to sell only pain, negativity, stress, and uncertainty, or to use those resources to look at things through a lens of gratitude, hope, resilience, optimism, and meaning. In other words, while we of course can't change reality thourgh sheer force of will alone, we can use our brain to change how we process the world, and that in turn changes how we react to it. Happiness is not about lying to ourselves, or turning a blind eye to the negative, but about adjusting our brain so that we see the ways to rise above our circumstances.</blockquote>

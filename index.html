  <blockquote>We can't buy just any tuna. The tuna vendor is a tuna expert. Our shrimp vendor is a shrimp expert. Each of the vendors are specialists in their fields. We are experts in sushi but in each of their specialties the vendors are more knowledgeable. We've built a relationship of trust with them.</blockquote>
